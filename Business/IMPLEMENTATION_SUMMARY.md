## üöÄ Ready for Integration

The business logic layer is now complete and ready for integration with:

1. **Web API Controllers**: All services are DI-ready
2. **Desktop Application**: Services can be injected into WPF/Windows Forms
3. **Database Layer**: Repository interfaces are properly integrated
4. **Testing**: All services are mockable and testable

## üìù Usage Example

```csharp
// Register services
services.AddBusinessServices();

// Use in controller
public class ProductController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IProductService _productService;
    
    public ProductController(IProductService productService)
    {
        _productService = productService;
    }
    
    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<ProductDTO>>> GetProducts()
    {
        var products = await _productService.GetAllProductsAsync();
        return Ok(products);
    }
}
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Integration**: Connect with Web API controllers
2. **Testing**: Implement unit tests for all services
3. **Caching**: Add caching layer for performance
4. **Logging**: Implement structured logging
5. **Validation**: Add FluentValidation for enhanced validation

The business logic layer provides a solid, production-ready foundation for the Pharmacy Management System with comprehensive business rules, validation, and data management capabilities.
